**Magic Square Generator in Python**

This Python program generates a magic square of odd order (size) using the Siamese method. A magic square is a square matrix where the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals is the same.

How it Works
The program defines a function magic_square(n) that takes an odd integer n as input and generates a magic square of order n. The Siamese method involves placing numbers in a specific pattern to ensure the magic property.

Usage
Run the program.
Enter the desired odd order n when prompted.
The program will generate and display the magic square.
Example
python
Copy code
python magic_square.py
Enter the size of the magic square (odd number): 3

Output:

mathematica
Copy code
Magic Square of Order 3:
2 7 6
9 5 1
4 3 8
Feel free to experiment with different odd orders and explore the properties of magic squares!
